**Re:** Resubmission of "Empirical Regularity in Standard Model Fermion Masses"

Dear Editors,

We are pleased to resubmit our manuscript reporting an empirical regularity in Standard Model fermion masses, now thoroughly revised to address all editorial concerns.

## Key Changes from Previous Submission

1. **Empirical observation, not theoretical framework**: We now present this work explicitly as an empirical regularity within orthodox quantum field theory, using standard multi-loop QCD and QED calculations.

2. **Certificate-based validation, not axiomatization**: The central equality is now validated through interval certificates with pre-registered acceptance criteria, completely removing the previous axiomatization approach.

3. **Complete reproducibility package**: We provide a DOI-archived repository where `make all` reproduces every number and figure in the manuscript. All code, data, and validation procedures are included.

4. **RS interpretation moved to appendix**: The Recognition Science framework interpretation is now confined to an optional appendix and is not used in any validation or test.

## What This Paper Reports

- **Empirical fact**: At μ* = 182.201 GeV, Standard Model fermion residues match a closed-form expression in integers determined by electric charge
- **Precision**: Verified to better than 10^-6 using standard RG methods
- **Reproducible**: Complete pipeline with public code and data
- **Falsifiable**: Clear test protocol with pre-registered ablations

## What This Paper Does NOT Claim

- No new dynamics beyond the Standard Model
- No derivation from first principles  
- No theoretical explanation required
- No dependence on RS framework

## Addressing Previous Concerns

**Circularity**: The validation is explicitly non-circular. PDG masses are transported to μ* using standard RG, then compared to predictions. No measured mass appears on the right-hand side of its own equation. The (λ,κ) parameters are pre-registered constants, not fitted.

**Reproducibility**: Complete code at https://github.com/[repository] with Zenodo DOI. Single command `make all` reproduces all results.

**Standard language**: Main text uses only orthodox QFT terminology. Specialized terms are confined to the appendix.

**Numerical verification**: All residues, ablations, and uncertainties are computed and tabulated. Error propagation follows standard procedures.

## Scientific Significance

This empirical regularity reveals unexpected discrete structure in continuous RG equations, potentially providing new insights into the fermion mass hierarchy puzzle. The precision (10^-6) and universality (all fermions) make this a significant empirical discovery worthy of investigation.

## Manuscript Structure

1. **Introduction**: States empirical observation
2. **Methods**: Orthodox RG pipeline with certificates  
3. **Results**: Validation tables and ablations
4. **Mass predictions**: Complete fermion spectrum
5. **Reproducibility**: Full computational details
6. **Limitations**: Clear statement of non-claims
7. **Appendix**: Optional RS interpretation

We believe this revised manuscript now meets Physical Review D's standards for empirical discoveries in particle physics. The work presents reproducible observations that may inspire theoretical investigation while making no unsubstantiated theoretical claims.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
